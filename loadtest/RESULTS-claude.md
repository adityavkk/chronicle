# RESULTS — epic #9 horizontal scale (claude orchestrator)

Real-deployment V&V evidence for the `epic-hscale-claude` branch. Captured per sub-issue
as each slice was reviewed and integrated. Every number here is measured, not asserted;
anything that requires a real GKE / multi-node / `STANDARD_HA` Redis substrate is recorded
**PENDING-CLOUD** because the active GCP project is inside a VPC Service Controls perimeter
that refuses all Compute API calls (environment-wide, reproducible, zero resources created —
confirmed by both orchestrators). Those carry the exact committed run spec + command so they
execute the moment a permitted GCP path is available.

## Test substrate used

- **Unit / pure-core:** `go test -short ./...` (both the root module and `loadgen/`) — no Redis, no clock.
- **Integration:** a local `redis:7` container (docker via colima), `REDIS_URL=redis://localhost:<port>/14 go test ./webhook/...`.
- **Jepsen safety/liveness/contention (T#/L#/C#):** the `jepsen/checker` harness driven against a
  **real running chronicle binary + a real Redis** (the local-binary path). The k3d multi-pod rig
  (`jepsen/up.sh`) was available but the colima VM (4 CPU / 8 GB) was continuously contended by a
  concurrent k3d cluster, so the multi-replica scenarios that need ≥2 pods + chaos were run where the
  VM allowed and otherwise recorded with their reproduce command. porcupine models are `Partition`-ed
  strictly per key (Unknown is treated as FAIL, never a pass); the recorder clock is pinned to the driver host.

## Per-issue V&V (integrated into epic-hscale-claude)

### #10 — V&V foundation + no-rebuild baseline (integrated)
- `go build/vet` + `go test -short ./...` GREEN (root + loadgen). Append-only `webhook.Metrics`
  extended with 6 methods (FanOut/DueSetMutation/DueWorkerTick/SlotOwnership/CoverageGap/OwnerFenced),
  consistent across interface / NopMetrics / Prometheus / golden test (GAP2).
- **T1 single-holder-linz** — porcupine leaseModel, **CheckResult Ok over 293 ops**; nemesis gcPause + clock-skew. GREEN.
- **T2 cursor-monotonic** (no-fault) GREEN. **T4 stale-gen-noop** GREEN (byte-identical durable snapshot).
- **L1 at-least-once** GREEN (every appended message delivered, 4/4 at tail). **L3 lease-tail-drop** GREEN (dropLeaseTail ZREM, only the cursor reconciler reaches tail, deposed ack FENCED).
- **Gate #1** (O(N·K) premise: CPU-vs-N at K=10k on Memorystore) — **PENDING-CLOUD**. Spec `loadtest/spec/sweep-10k-scale.yaml`; cmd `cd loadtest && make up && make gate1 && make down`.

### #11 — Claim granularity / third axis (Phase 1, the actual collapse) (integrated)
- **C1/C2 reproduce the empirical 6-clean / 12-collapse** on today's per-type subscription, no rebuild:
  at **G=1** per-worker throughput halves **21.7 → 10.4 → 5.2 ops/s** as claimants rise 6→12→24 while
  aggregate pins ~125/s and BUSY/op → 0.97 — the fence storm.
- **C3 / doc-05 gate #6 PASS (acceptance gate):** at **G=16** per-worker throughput holds **~27 flat**
  and aggregate **scales 158 → 336 → 650**; the collapse knee moved beyond G=16 (~G×). BUSY/FENCED at fixed N drop ~G×.
- **T1 still holds per `(subId, g)`** (porcupine shard-linz, partitioned per shard, Unknown=fail). Cross-shard ack impossible (proven live). Shard 0 / G=1 byte-identical to today.
- `ClaimContention` metric appended (cardinality-safe — subID discarded, only status is a label).
- Design doc `docs/specs/horizontal-scale/research/08-claim-granularity.md` (per-shard-of-type, G=16) + a ready-to-file Electric-repo client tracking issue.

### #12 — Due-set outbox (Move 2) (integrated)
- `ds:{__ds}:due` outbox ZADD/ZREM'd in arm_wake/ack/expire_lease/release (GAP3 closed, regression-tested: a released sub leaves no phantom due-mark). `dueWorker` drains owed subs O(owed) via the unchanged `claim_due.lua`; full sweep retained as backstop. Pure `DecideDue` reconcile core.
- **T1/T2/T4/L1/L3 GREEN** (fence untouched) via the local-binary path; **merged #11+#12 Redis integration GREEN** (full webhook suite, real run). Composition: webhook acks run g=0 where the due member == id, so ZADD/ZREM match; g>0 pull-wake shards never touch the due-set.
- **Gate #3** (due-set write amplification, DueSetMutation QPS) — **PENDING-CLOUD**. Spec `loadtest/spec/due-10k.yaml`.

### #13 — Event-triggered recovery + coarse floor (integrated)
- `recoverySweeper` split into `reconcile(scope)` (sealed sum type Boot|Reconnect|AppendError|Floor + a stubbed EpochBump|NewOwnerCAS case for #14) + a coarse floor raised **2 s → 30 s**. `reconcileLeases` re-derives a stranded live/waking sub's dropped lease+due tail from the durable sub hash via a fence-safe `restore_lease.lua` (schedule-only, never the generation/wake_id fence). `sweepOnce` preserved byte-for-byte (no owner guard).
- **T1/T2/T4/L1 GREEN**; **L3 sharpened to `-floor=0` + explicit takeover and GREEN** (the eager reconcile at the takeover trigger reaches tail, far under the 30 s server floor → a tick cannot be the recoverer). doc-07 honest-gap #4 resolved. Integrated-branch Redis integration GREEN (real run).
- Steady-state delivery latency unchanged by the floor raise (the 2 s sweep fired nothing in steady state). No standalone gate.

### #14 — Leased slot ownership (Move 3) (integrated)
- `claim_shard.lua` CAS over `ds:{ownership}:slot:<h>` + `check_owner.lua` (external POST only); membership heartbeat + HRW (FNV-1a + splitmix64 finalize, ~1/N reassignment) + slot-reconcile loop; workers gated by `ownedSlots() = HRW ∩ held-leases`; `sweepOnce` stays the UNGUARDED backstop. TOCTOU owner-epoch check inlined in arm_wake/ack/expire_lease/schedule_retry/release (gated on a non-empty epoch — the load-balanced external path is unchanged; the owner scope is threaded through the retry path too). New-owner CAS fires #13's `reconcile(scopeNewOwnerCAS)`. ReplicaID + 4 TTLs with invariant tests. Pure FCIS core; distinct `SlotID`/`OwnerEpoch`/`ReplicaID` types (no collision with #11's `ClaimShard`/`ShardKey`).
- **T3 (THE acceptance gate) PASS** — porcupine `shardModel` CAS-register, partitioned per slot, Unknown=FAIL: linearizable over 165–275 ops / 4 partitions across seeds, **and proven to have teeth** (an injected epoch-reuse/LWW bug flips the same run to *Illegal* with a counterexample, end-to-end).
- **T1/T2/T4/L1 stay GREEN** under the owner-epoch fence layered ABOVE (never replacing) the `(gen,wake_id)` fence — that fence is byte-for-byte unchanged. bump-on-transfer-only fences a deposed-then-resumed owner. Build/vet/test-short + full webhook Redis integration GREEN.
- **Gate #4** (membership churn window: coverage gap ≤ membership-lease TTL + RTT, ZERO lost wakes / ZERO double-grants; total work O(total owed) regardless of N — the inverse of #10's gate #1) and **L2 / L4** need ≥2 replicas + chaos on a clean multi-node rig — **env-scoped** (the local colima VM is co-tenanted with the other orchestrator's k3d cluster, which must not be touched). Rig built: `loadtest/spec/sweep-10k-churn.yaml` (replicas≥2) + `ltctl gate4` (pod-kill the slot owner, scrape coverage-gap/ownership/fence metrics); recorded **PENDING-CLOUD** with the exact reproduce commands.

### #15 — Slot-homed state shard (Move 1) (integrated)
- Slot-home a whole subscription's key set under one `{__ds:h}` tag, `h = fnv32a(subId) % 256` (Go `hash/fnv`, **FNV-1a — not CRC16**; `slotOf` strips the `#11 :g:<n>` suffix so a sub's g-shards home to its slot and a drained shard member resolves back to `subShardKey`). `subKey`/`linksKey` re-tagged; `subsKey`/`leaseZKey`/`retryZKey`/`dueZKey` → `func(h int)`; `streamSubsKey(h,path)` per-slot fan-out shard; the typed `OccupiedSlots` bitmap (`ds:{__ds-occ}:streamslots:<path>`). JWKS/token singletons keep the fixed `{__ds}` tag; `{ownership}` keys unchanged. `ownershipSlots = subSlots` so `ownedSlots()` iterates the real S slots (was the degenerate S=1).
- **GAP4**: `List()`/`ReconcileIndexes()`/`LeasedIDs()` UNION across the S per-slot sets (pipelined); `StreamSubscribers` scatter-gathers across the occupied-slots bitmap and reports `slotsProbed`; `DueLeases`/`DueRetries`/`ClaimDue` take a slot `h`; the lease/retry/due workers iterate `ownedSlots()` draining per-slot schedules under each slot's owner scope. Every per-sub atomic script stays byte-for-byte single-slot (one `h` per id) — proven single-Redis-cluster-slot by the guard test (CRC16 of the tag).
- `OnStreamAppend` → `S` parallel pipelined `SMEMBERS` over occupied slots; `FanOut(dur, slotsProbed, subs)` wired and **visible in `/metrics`** (`chronicle_fanout_seconds`, `chronicle_fanout_slots_probed`). Shadow-write + **lazy per-sub migration** (read old `{__ds}` tag, write new `{__ds:h}`, flip) — reversible (S is a const, legacy readers retained, copy-then-flip).
- **T5 (THE acceptance gate) PASS** — the live `slot-isolation` differential checker (local Redis): 320 subs over 8 streams spanning **204/256** keyspace slots, the S-slot scatter-gather subscriber set **≡ the independent reference ≡ the brute-force all-S union** for every stream, **zero foreign wakes**, held under concurrent ownership-slot churn (the two axes are isolated); every sub whole-homed in one cluster slot; a mis-tag **DETECTED** (CROSSSLOT). Pure differential unit-tested (`go test ./jepsen/checker -run SlotLeakage`).
- **T1/T2/T4/L1 stay GREEN** under slot-homing (fence/cursor slot-homed but byte-for-byte unchanged), re-run via the **local-binary path** (chronicle on `:4437` + one Redis): `single-holder-linz` (T1) linearizable; `stale-gen-noop` (T4) FENCED no-op; `cursor-monotonic` (T2) forward-only under churn; `baseline`/`at-least-once`/`index-repair` (L1) 6/6 streams at tail. Build/vet/`test -short` + full webhook Redis integration GREEN.
- **Gate #2** (the deciding fan-out p99) is **PENDING-CLOUD** — loopback erases the max-node-RTT it measures. The implementation is reversible + T5-correct, so it SHIPS with gate #2 recorded PENDING-CLOUD; the production enable/defer decision awaits the cloud p99 (see "Gate #2" below).

### #16 — DR + system-level capstone (integrated)
- **Active-passive DR, the only new mechanism.** (1) Tier B **`WAITAOF`/`WAIT` durability barrier** on the fence-minting writes (`ArmWake` ARMED / `Claim` CLAIMED, after the generation `HINCRBY`), client checks the returned pair via the pure `InterpretWaitAOF`/`InterpretWait` core; a short reply is a surfaced error, never swallowed. (2) **`Manager.Promote()`** re-establishes ownership on the promoted primary + fires the failover-aware eager reconcile (`scopeEpochBump` → `reconcileLeases` re-derives stranded lease/due tails from the durable `sub` hash). (3) The **sealed `ConsistencyTier` A/B/C** config surface (`CHRONICLE_CONSISTENCY_TIER`/`_WAIT_REPLICAS`/`_WAIT_TIMEOUT_MS`, parsed at the env boundary); only Tier B touches the hot path, Tier C is the read-your-writes freshness-token stub. **Correction #3:** `WAIT`/`WAITAOF` are durability, NOT linearizability — the monotonic `(gen,wake_id)` fence stays the only exclusivity guard; no path infers ordering/exclusivity from the count.
- **T1–T5 GREEN (local-binary path, one AOF Redis).** T1 `single-holder-linz` linearizable (463 ops); T1′ `shard-linz -G 8` linearizable per `(subId,g)`; T2 `cursor-monotonic` forward-only, 49 real deliveries; T3 `ownership-exclusivity` CAS-linearizable (157 ops/4 slots); T4 `stale-gen-noop` deposed ack `409 FENCED`, cursor byte-identical; T5 `slot-isolation` scatter ≡ reference ≡ brute, 0 foreign wakes, CROSSSLOT detected. **Tier B system-level proof:** re-ran T1 with chronicle in Tier B (`WAITAOF 1 0`) — Redis `cmdstat_waitaof: calls=16, rejected=0, failed=0` (barrier genuinely exercised) and T1 stayed `linearizable: yes` (durability did not alter exclusivity).
- **In-process units GREEN** (`go test ./webhook`): L3 `TestLeaseTailDropRecoveredByEagerReconcile` (cursor-only recovery + deposed FENCED) + `TestPromoteDrivesEagerReconcile` (stranded `waking` sub re-ZADDed at promotion); the arm→emit failpoint `TestFailpointArmedBeforeEmitStrandsThenRecovers` (07 honest-gap #2, dependency-free seam — gofail proper is a documented build-system follow-up); the Tier B durability tests + `TestWaitIsDurabilityNotLinearizability`.
- **STANDARD_HA substrate authored** (`jepsen/deploy/standard-ha.yaml` + `standard-ha-failover.sh`; `ltctl --redis-tier=STANDARD_HA` + `gate5`; `spec/dispatch-webhook-ha.yaml`). **Gate #5 + L2/L4/L5 + gates #2–#4 at scale + RPO/RTO + K=10k = PENDING-CLOUD** (shared colima co-tenanted with `k3d-bakeoff`; the orchestrator owns the cloud). Full ledger + exact commands in `docs/jepsen/results.md` "DR + the system-level capstone (issue #16)".

## Gate ledger (doc-05 gates #1–#6)

| Gate | Owner | Property | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| #6 | #11 | per-type claim contention — knee moves ~G× | **GREEN** (C3: G=16 knee beyond range; per-worker flat, aggregate scales) |
| #1 | #10 | O(N·K) premise (CPU-vs-N at K=10k) | PENDING-CLOUD (VPC-SC) — spec + cmd committed |
| #3 | #12 | due-set write amplification | PENDING-CLOUD — spec `due-10k.yaml` |
| #4 | #14 | membership churn window (coverage gap ≤ TTL+RTT, 0 lost / 0 double-grant) | T3 acceptance gate GREEN (local); the churn-window number is PENDING-CLOUD (needs ≥2 replicas + chaos; rig built: sweep-10k-churn.yaml + ltctl gate4) |
| #2 | #15 | OnStreamAppend fan-out p99 (S=2/4/8/256, real multi-node) | **PENDING-CLOUD** — loopback erases max-node-RTT; spec `fanout-gate2.yaml` + `ltctl gate2` + FanOut metric committed; T5 correctness GREEN locally |
| #5 | #16 | failover fence drill (STANDARD_HA): stranded sub recovered ONLY by the cursor-reading reconciler + deposed ack 409 FENCED | **PENDING-CLOUD** — substrate + drill committed (`jepsen/deploy/standard-ha.yaml` + `standard-ha-failover.sh`; `ltctl gate5` + `spec/dispatch-webhook-ha.yaml`); L3 + promotion proven in-process; gate-#5 fence proof needs a real failover cluster |

## Gate #2 — OnStreamAppend fan-out p99 (the deciding number for slot-homing) — PENDING-CLOUD

Pre-slot-homing, `OnStreamAppend` is ONE `SMEMBERS`. Slot-homed it is `S` PARALLEL
pipelined `SMEMBERS` over the stream's OCCUPIED slots — go-redis groups per cluster
node, so wall-clock is **~max-node-RTT** (the slots span nodes), the real regression.
The occupied-slots bitmap mitigation keeps the probe set at occupied-slots-per-stream,
not `S`.

**Why PENDING-CLOUD:** the number gate #2 decides on is the max-node-RTT — and
**loopback / single-node Redis ERASES it**. The local run below proves CORRECTNESS
(T5) and that the FanOut metric is wired and the bitmap holds, but its p99 is a
loopback figure, not the cluster regression. The implementation is reversible
(shadow-write + lazy migration; `S` is a compile-time const) and T5-correct, so it
**SHIPS** with gate #2 recorded PENDING-CLOUD; the production **enable/defer** decision
(05's recommendation) awaits the cloud p99.

**Local loopback sanity (single `redis:7`, `chronicle -metrics-listen :9099`):** over the
T1/T2/L1 webhook runs, `chronicle_fanout_seconds` recorded 724 fan-outs, p99 well under
5 ms; `chronicle_fanout_slots_probed` ≤ 4 for every append (never 256) — the bitmap
mitigation collapses the probe set to occupied-slots-per-stream as designed. (Loopback,
so NOT the gate-#2 number.)

**The S=2/4/8/256 sweep + exact command (real multi-node Redis Cluster, ≥2 chronicle replicas):**
`S = subSlots` is a compile-time const, so each S is a SEPARATE SUT image — build
chronicle with `const subSlots = <S>` for S ∈ {2,4,8,256}, push four tags, then:

```
cd loadtest && ./ltctl.sh up
for S in 2 4 8 256; do LT_TAG="s$S" ./ltctl.sh gate2 spec/fanout-gate2.yaml; done
```

`gate2` (committed) deploys `spec/fanout-gate2.yaml` at replicas≥2 (so the `{__ds:h}`
slots genuinely span Redis nodes), drives the wide-stream webhook fan-out workload, and
scrapes `chronicle_fanout_seconds` (the p99 gate) + `chronicle_fanout_slots_probed` (the
bitmap effect) into `gate2-<S>-metrics.txt` / `gate2-results.tsv`.

**Pass criteria:** `chronicle_fanout_seconds` p99 within the wake-latency budget at S=256
(the regression = `fanout_p99(S) − single-SMEMBERS baseline`) — **within budget ⇒ enable
slot-homing; over budget ⇒ DEFER per 05** and #16 runs its non-T5 suite against the
single-slot ownership build. `slots_probed` must track occupied-slots-per-stream (not S).
The K=10k sweep p99 baseline reproduces (< 1500 ms) as the regression floor.

## Gate #5 — the DR failover-fence drill (issue #16) — PENDING-CLOUD

The headline DR gate: drop the lease-ZSET tail mid-lease on a **`STANDARD_HA`** Redis,
then fail over for real, and confirm **only** the cursor-reading failover-aware eager
reconcile recovers the stranded webhook sub **and** a deposed ack returns **409
`FENCED`** (not silent success) — 07's L3 at the real-failover level.

**Why PENDING-CLOUD:** a real failover needs a SECOND node promoted while the first is
gone + a stable endpoint across the promotion (07 honest-gap #3 — the single-Redis
`deploy.yaml` only replays AOF). The shared colima VM is co-tenanted with the other
orchestrator's `k3d-bakeoff` cluster, which must not be contended. The L3 property and
the promotion-driven recovery are proven **in-process** (`go test ./webhook -run
'LeaseTailDrop|PromoteDrivesEagerReconcile'`); the real-failover run is the orchestrator's.

**Substrate + drill (committed):**
- `jepsen/deploy/standard-ha.yaml` — primary + AOF replica + a stable `redis` Service
  the failover repoints by flipping one selector (no chronicle client change; `WAITAOF
  1 1` has a real replica to ack).
- `jepsen/deploy/standard-ha-failover.sh` — applies the substrate, runs `lease-tail-drop
  -floor 0` before AND after a REAL promotion (kill primary → `REPLICAOF NO ONE` → flip
  the endpoint → roll chronicle's boot reconcile), and **always tears down**.
- Managed path: `cd loadtest && ./ltctl.sh up --redis-tier=STANDARD_HA && ./ltctl.sh gate5 spec/dispatch-webhook-ha.yaml` (then `./ltctl.sh down`). `gate5` runs the full-system dispatch:webhook load (Tier B, replicas≥2, S=256), triggers Memorystore's managed failover mid-measure, and asserts the SLO + fence + zero-lost/zero-double-grant; self-teardown trap.

**Pass criteria:** stranded sub recovered ONLY by the cursor-reading reconciler; deposed
ack `409 FENCED` (`chronicle_owner_fenced_total` rises); zero lost wakes; zero
double-grants; the K=10k sweep p99 holds within the 509 ms floor under combined chaos +
DR drill.

**RPO / RTO:** `RPO` = async replication lag + AOF fsync (`appendfsync everysec`, ~1 s)
+ link latency (bounded, > 0); Tier B `WAITAOF 1 1` shrinks the acked-write RPO to the
replica-fsync ack. `RTO` = promotion time (managed failover / `REPLICAOF NO ONE` +
endpoint repoint + chronicle reconnect/boot reconcile). Both recorded by the drill.

## K=10k regression floor

`loadtest/RESULTS-gke.md` baseline: sweep p99 **509 ms**, SLO PASS. Reproduction on a real
cluster is **PENDING-CLOUD**; the requirement (sweep p99 < 1500 ms) is carried as the standing
floor and the spec (`loadtest/spec/sweep-10k.yaml` + the `-scale` variant) is committed.
For #16 the floor must hold under the **combined chaos + DR drill**:
`loadtest/spec/dispatch-webhook-ha.yaml` (S=256, replicas≥2, `STANDARD_HA`, Tier B) is
the full-system load+chaos+failover run that re-asserts it — `ltctl gate5`.
