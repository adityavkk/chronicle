# Replicated Electric engine experiment

This isolated Rust binary extends Electric's actual native storage/read engine.
It does not alter Chronicle's Go/Redis default, and it is not the SQLite-backed
`rust/distributed-streams` experiment. **Not production-qualified.**

The imported source is Electric npm 0.1.5 at
[`88793e7`](https://github.com/electric-sql/electric/commit/88793e76595d69be300731b9b25c58538923a53b),
Apache-2.0. `UPSTREAM-TREE.txt` pins original blobs; `engine/LICENSE` retains the
license. OpenRaft 0.9.25 provides consensus over Electric's WAL/group-fsync path.
Committed commands materialize the native wire files; native file-range/sendfile
and epoll SSE paths serve reads. No SQLite, RocksDB or Redis payload dependency.

## Contracts and scope

* [CONTRACT.md](CONTRACT.md): partitions, quorum-fsync acknowledgements, unknown
  outcomes, linearizable/prefix/session reads, recovery and source provenance.
* [TIMED-STATE.md](TIMED-STATE.md): committed TTL/access clock and replay.
* [FORKS.md](FORKS.md): cross-partition retained-prefix grants, bounded wire import,
  hidden publication and descendant-aware release.
* [SUBSCRIPTIONS.md](SUBSCRIPTIONS.md): partition-owned durable webhook/pull-wake
  leases, cursors, fencing, retries, signing, SSRF validation and catalog repair.
* [evidence/README.md](evidence/README.md): executed gates and preserved failures.

Paths hash to fixed groups, not to the current node count. Replica movement uses
learner catch-up and joint membership; it does not repartition a live stream.
One ordered stream still has one owner group. There is no general cross-group
transaction or global read snapshot. The experimental control plane is trusted,
loopback-only; it is not a production authentication/transport design.

Only quorum-fsync writes are offered. An HTTP timeout/503 after admission can
have committed; producer epoch/sequence handles append retry effects. Reads use
`Stream-Consistency: linearizable` by default. `prefix` allows unbounded staleness;
`session` requires a same-cluster, same-partition `Stream-Session` response token.
Live streams become committed-prefix feeds after their initial read barrier.

`scripts/benchmark.py` uses the pinned unmodified native server and ds-bench
binaries at `.tmp/electric-tools/{upstream,bench}-target/release/`; their SHA-256
values and exact source pins are in each run's `provenance.json`. It records fresh
per-cell configurations, command lines, exact seed/offset probes, raw client/HDR
results, syscall profiles, process/socket samples (`samples.jsonl.gz`), storage
sizes and errors. Run it sequentially with other builds/tests stopped.

Use a fresh output directory name each time. Drivers start/stop supervised orb
services; data directories are disposable under `.tmp/electric-labs/`. They keep
per-node JSON configuration, source/binary hashes, logs and raw histories. None
creates cloud infrastructure. The full conformance suite runs unchanged with
`subscriptions:true`, three processes and two partitions, with initial leaders
co-located for its single direct HTTP endpoint. The fork fault campaign starts
the two leaders on different nodes and verifies actual learner snapshot install.

Building without `--features replication` retains standalone native mode. The
replicated binary starts with `--cluster-config <node.json>`; the harness writes
examples. It rejects old experimental data identities rather than silently
migrating them. Never start two copies of one node identity, even on different
disks; filesystem locking only fences one local directory.

## Remaining gates

Conformance and the existing fault/property tests are necessary, not sufficient.
The latest full suite executes **332/332 passing, zero failures/skips**, with
subscriptions enabled. Subscription and storage-error process histories also
pass within their documented models; they are not independent-disk or power-loss
qualification. `bench-local-003` ran 45 matched ds-bench cells: 44 completed;
three-replica fanout with 1,000 subscribers failed with linearizable-read 503s
and a 240-second client timeout. It is retained, not excluded from the matrix.

| Local qualification cell | Unmodified Electric | One-member adapter | Three replicas |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| One stream, concurrency 256 (writes/s) | 105,103 | 3,471 | 4,352 |
| 1,024 streams, concurrency 256 (writes/s) | 58,861 | 3,501 | 3,949 |
| Seeded 4 MiB replay (GiB/s) | 13.87 | 9.71 | 15.80 |
| Mixed, unpaced writes and fixed-rate reads (writes/s) | 26,982 | 6,843 | 4,793 |

These short single runs share a disk/page cache and 16 GiB host memory. Each arm
gets four aggregate SUT CPU affinities, the client another four; the three-node
arm does not get three times the CPU budget. Native and one-member writes are
local-fsync; three-node writes are quorum-fsync on this **shared host**. The client
is not independently calibrated and the native write ladder has not plateaued.
Replay is page-cache/loopback throughput, not disk bandwidth; different runs vary
substantially. Paced fanout is not saturation capacity. Profiles are separate,
perturbed executions: all read arms call real `sendfile`; write profiles show
substantial fsync and scheduling costs. The adapter has a large measured write
gap, not Electric performance parity. Independent-host capacity, sustained memory
and disk growth, tail latency, and overload behavior remain evaluation gates.

No throughput or availability promise is made from blog numbers or single-orb
runs. Paid evaluation needs separate authorization; no cloud budget or publication
permission is implied.

Physical WAL reclamation now uses a checksummed metadata-only checkpoint; old
snapshot cleanup preserves open transfer descriptors. The new real-process
campaign injects checkpoint write/fsync/directory-fsync errors before reclaim,
then verifies physical deletion and complete restart against 38,010,880 payload bytes.
The measurements above precede this lifecycle change, not a post-change rerun.

Cold-tier ownership/GC and terminal transaction-fence compaction remain
unimplemented. Catalog repair
scans and subscription/fork cardinality need scale qualification. Snapshots pause
one group's apply while copying its files; the cost must be measured. Native
JSON sub-offset resolution now scans bounded 64 KiB windows with lexical state
across chunk boundaries; generated native-WAL/snapshot/restart cases cover nested
values, quoted commas, escapes and large values. Pure Lean chunk-composition
lemmas do not prove the Rust scanner or native file reader correct.
